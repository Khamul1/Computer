Java-begin courses

the task on basic topics (before abstraction), but with if conditions (also topics association, constructor, methods, object properties) is to create a computer with 4 properties: monitor (name, size),
processor (number of cores, for example 8), mouse (name), keyboard (name, number-in the number of buttons). The computer has a method to Turn on, which writes that the computer has turned on successfully 
and prints all its data (monitor name, processor size, and others). If one of their components is missing (for example, they forgot to connect the mouse, i.e. the property is null) - then print that the 
computer did not turn on due to the fact that there is not enough mouse. You need to check each of the enabled devices and if some is missing, then print about it and do not turn on the computer
